# Discord Logger Bot (Go)

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system at least v1.24.1.

3. Export the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable with your Discord bot token:
   ```bash
   export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your-discord-bot-token>
   ```

   Replace `<your-discord-bot-token>` with your actual bot token.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

   This will start the bot locally.
